# MediTrack-System
 Perfect for small-scale healthcare management.
Project Overview
The Health Information System is a Python-based console application designed to manage patient data efficiently. It allows users to record, retrieve, and analyze patient information such as vital signs and visit dates. The system is built with a focus on simplicity and functionality, making it easy to navigate through different options via a menu-driven interface.

Features
Display All Patient Data:

View a comprehensive list of all patients and their associated health data.
Search by Patient ID:

Retrieve and display detailed health records for a specific patient using their unique ID.
Add Patient Data:

Input new health records including temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
Data is stored persistently in a text file for future access.
Statistics Generation:

Generate and display statistical data, such as average vital signs, for a specific patient or across all patients in the system.
Visit Search by Date:

Find and display patient visits based on specific year, month, or both, allowing users to track patient progress over time.
Follow-Up Identification:

Automatically identify and list patients who require follow-up visits based on their health data.
Delete Patient Visits:

Remove all visit records of a particular patient from the system.
User-Friendly Menu Interface:

The application offers an easy-to-use menu system, guiding users through each functionality with clear prompts.

How It Works
Data Storage: Patient data is stored in a text file (patients.txt), ensuring that all inputs are saved and can be retrieved in future sessions.
Error Handling: The system includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and ensure data integrity.
Scalability: The design allows for easy extension of additional features, such as more complex data analysis or integration with databases.

Future Enhancements
Database Integration: Moving from text file storage to a relational database for better data management and query capabilities.
User Authentication: Adding a user login system to secure patient data and allow multi-user access.
GUI Development: Enhancing the user interface by developing a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the system.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
File Handling: Text-based data storage
Data Structures: Lists and dictionaries for data management
